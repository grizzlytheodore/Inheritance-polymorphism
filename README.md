# Inheritance-Polymorphism
Written in C++. An object oriented programming to practice inheritance and polymorphism.

A board-game-like medieval scene.
There are Nobles who are parent classes to Nobles-With-Strength-to-Fight and Lords. 
Lords hire Protectors.
Protector is the parent class to Warrior and Wizard.
Warrior is parent class to Archer and Swordman.

The classes inherit methods from its parent classes and some methods are
specialized for the child class using polymorphism.
